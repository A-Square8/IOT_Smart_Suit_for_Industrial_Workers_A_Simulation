# Multi-Sensor Library & Smart Suit Simulation

A comprehensive software simulation and multi-sensor library designed for industrial worker safety. This project models various sensors and actuators in an embedded system, simulating real-world scenarios to enhance worker protection in hazardous environments.

## Features



### Smart Suit Simulation
- **Distributed System Architecture:** Uses socket-based communication between modules.
- **Modules:**
  - Environment Simulation (User-defined hazard conditions).
  - Sensor Module (Data acquisition and analysis).
  - Control Module (Decision-making and response).
  - Actuator Module (Protective response simulation).
- **Software Simulation Features:**
  - **Proteus Simulation:** Circuit-based modeling of sensor interactions and hardware validation.
  - **C-Based Simulation:** Modular program execution for sensor readings, decision-making, and actuator responses.
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Provides interactive controls and real-time monitoring.
  - **Scenario-based Testing:** Adjustable environmental conditions for safety protocol validation.
  - **Data Logging:** Sensor readings stored in CSV format for analysis.
